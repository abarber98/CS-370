# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In project two, I created a while loop to run the application.
This loop allowed the pirate agent to make actions on movement thorugh exploration, and eventually exploitation.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists build the backbones of a lot of our modern conveniences. They build the applications, websites, 
and programs that people around the world use on a daily basis. They keep our tech-reliant world turning in a sense.
They also carry the burden of ensuring that their creations are ethical and user-friendly.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I thoroughly read through what is expected of me and gather all the necessary requirements.
I then try to break problems down into smaller chunks and tackle them in smaller blocks.
This helps to do more focused research and testing of solutions that I come up with.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

I think the easiest solution to a lot of ethical concerns is transparency with your users.
Data handling is a huge cocern for most individuals and organizations so data security and data deletion
are high on my list of importance when thinking of the development of systems.
